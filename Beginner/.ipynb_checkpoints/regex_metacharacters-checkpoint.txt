Regular Expression Metacharacters

1. Basic Metacharacters
------------------------
.       - Matches any single character except newline
^       - Matches the start of a string
$       - Matches the end of a string
*       - Matches 0 or more repetitions of the preceding element
+       - Matches 1 or more repetitions of the preceding element
?       - Matches 0 or 1 of the preceding element; also used to make quantifiers non-greedy
[]      - Matches any one character in the brackets (character class)
[^]     - Matches any one character NOT in the brackets
|       - Acts as an OR between expressions
()      - Groups expressions; also captures matched content

2. Quantifiers
--------------
{n}     - Exactly n repetitions
{n,}    - n or more repetitions
{n,m}   - Between n and m repetitions (includes m)

3. Escape Character
-------------------
\      - Escapes a metacharacter or introduces special sequences (like \d, \w)

4. Common Escaped Sequences
---------------------------
\d     - Digit (0–9)
\D     - Non-digit
\w     - Word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _ )
\W     - Non-word character
\s     - Whitespace (space, tab, newline)
\S     - Non-whitespace (NOT (space, tab, newline))
\b     - Word boundary
\B     - Not a word boundary
\\     - Literal backslash

\n     - refers/variable to the n capturing group—the part of the pattern wrapped in the first pair of parentheses ()
            - e.g. \1
